#  Sales Performance Dashboard – Power BI Project

##  Project Description

This project consists of the development of a **Sales Performance Dashboard** built in Power BI using the *Superstore* dataset.

The main objective is to analyze business performance through key performance indicators (KPIs), monthly sales trends, top-selling products, highest-performing categories, and top customers.

The dashboard transforms raw data into strategic insights to support data-driven decision-making.
